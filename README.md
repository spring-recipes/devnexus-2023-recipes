# Spring Recipes: A Collection of Common-Sense Solutions

Over the years, Spring has evolved to meet the increasing demands placed on software teams. From circuit breakers to security to queues to Kubernetes, Spring has an answer for all of them! However, the breadth of features can be overwhelming, especially when you need to deploy to production quickly. While knowing is only half of the battle, applying that knowledge to real-world situations is equally important. In other words, how do you bridge the gap between knowing that Spring can solve a problem and actually using Spring to fix the issue?
